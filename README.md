# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Invoice app

This is a solution to the [Invoice app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl) challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The challenge was to build out this invoicing application and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
